## Description 

Created by Colin Laganier and Thomas Le Menestrel.

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection[1]. This highschool project hid text in png images from a simple GUI and extracted hidden text back from these images. 

Coded in Python 3.6.
